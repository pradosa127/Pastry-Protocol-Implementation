1. Team Members:

Pradosa Patnaik (UFID: 1288-9584)
Supraba Muruganantham (UFID: 9215-9813)
2. Code Submitted:

project3.ex

3. How To Run

To run Pastry algorithm using Full network topology the command is as follows:
 Compile the project from the project3 directory.
$ mix escript.build
Run the project with the command
$  ./project3 numNodes numRequests
E.g.   $  ./project3 100 10
4. What is working

The Basic program for the Pastry algorithm is working including join and route mechanisms.

5. What is the largest network we can manage

For the basic program (project3.ex), up to 100,00 nodes can be supported.

Larger network may be supported, but may take a longer time.
